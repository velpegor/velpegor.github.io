<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a M.S. student at <a href="https://cvlab.yonsei.ac.kr/" style="color: #7289da; text-decoration: none;">CVLab</a> in Yonsei University, advised by Prof. Bumsub Ham, and also affiliated with <a href="https://kdst.re.kr/" style="color: #7289da; text-decoration: none;">KDST</a> in Kyung Hee University (formerly at KIST), co-advised by Prof. Suhyun Kim.

I am broadly interested in building trustworthy and safe AI that can operate reliably under real-world conditions. 

My recent research interests include the following topics:
* **Trustworthy and Safe AI**: Jailbreak, Safety Evaluation, Benchmark, Human Alignment
* **Improving the Capabilities of AI**: Transformer-based Understanding, LLM & VLM Reasoning

If you are interested in collaborating with me on research projects, please feel free to send me an email!
