<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a M.S. student at <a href="https://cvlab.yonsei.ac.kr/" style="color: #7289da; text-decoration: none;">CVLab</a> in Yonsei University, advised by Prof. Bumsub Ham, and also affiliated with <a href="https://kdst.re.kr/" style="color: #7289da; text-decoration: none;">KDST</a> in Kyung Hee University (formerly at KIST), co-advised by Prof. Suhyun Kim.

I am broadly interested in building trustworthy and safe AI that can operate reliably under real-world conditions. In parallel, I am also interested in making large model architectures more adaptable and efficient.

My recent research interests include the following topics:
* Trustworthy and Safe AI
* Efficient Architecture for Large Models
